                  <p class="text-muted">After our first client meeting we produced our project proposal we set out a plan to follow a Agile Scrum methodology. In the intial weeks we spent time planning and learning the technology stack, then the plan was to start a series 
                    of incremental sprints. Following a Scrum process the team would meet with the client to complete a sprint retrospective plan for the next sprint. However as time went along risks and issues occured which changed the flow and direction of the plan. Being Agile our team accomadated to these issues and adapted to make the nessary changes. As a R&D Team we set up a <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/b/5XYBQ9sb/research-and-development-flating-application">Trello board</a> assigned tasks to complete our proposal and store our R&D artefacts like learning objectives

                <div class="timeline-body">
                  <p class="text-muted">At the start of our project we had the asana board set up to follow scrum and for the team to be sprinting. 
                    During the first semster we would meet with our client every 2-3 weeks as our sprint retrospective talk about what needed to be improved on, grooom the backlog, delegate ready to do tasks to members.
                    As a team we were completing stand up meetings via facebook messenger and then also communicating progress to the client via slack. The rules of SCRUM where not followed stricitly by the team likely becuase working 
                    with a start up company "flying by the seat of your pants". In the second part of the project (semester 1) there was diffculty communicationg with the client and the team was 'lost' for the first two weeks of the semester.
                    After finally meeting with the client all they wanted was a user testing report and no longer wanted any development to be done. However a week later we had a list of tasks to complete. Having the summer break upset the project plan 
                    and we lost track of what needed to be as our goals for the project seemed to be unclear. Even in the beginning of the project the specfic tasks where not set out clearly for the team as it seemed the client was not sure on our capablity 
                    of completing certain tasks. Orinally Casey was the main contact with the clients however in the second semster Latrell took over as he recieved first contact in the part two of the project. Lastly in the last month of our project we lost contact from our 
                    client and after trying to contact them we found they would not be working on the project until after we finsihed university. This threw a spanner in the works for the project plan.

We set the stand up meetings to one to two times per week. 
                    Some of the stand up meetings were unorthadox were others followed the set questions.

                  <p class="text-muted">When we would meet with the client we would complete a sprint retrospective verbally and then as an R&D team wrttien. We would also complete sprint planning
                    in the planning process as a team we would decide what tasks needed to be worked on and move them from the product backlog to the ready to do sprint lane. 
                    We would set due dates for tasks although for some taks this method was not realistic. Using story points may have been a better option and play 'planning poker' to score each task. However planning poker is 
                    not part of scrum it is just an additional feature <strong>INSERT REF</strong> and the client did not follow this practice. Another artefact we did not use that is often used in scrum is a burndown or burnup chart. We did not use this because 
                    we did not put story points on the tasks. Also not all tasks had due dates, this then lead to the idea the team was more following a kanban methodolgy of constant flow of tasks.

            <p>
            Research activities really help us to have a general view of current markets related to the Flaties application; as well as help the team to understand not only services and marketing, but also technical things. Researching and analysis documentations are very important in terms of competition with other organizations similar with Flaties, and also upskilling of IT management project as well as technical skills. During the project, development activities have been done in collaboration of our team and Flaties team. Outcomes for this process must be take into accounts are knowing more platform, database and other technical skills, also how to handle all these tech stack. Therefore, these experiences have been really helpful for when we go out there in the real world and start our careers.

          <p>When developing a task from Asana, we assign ourselves into the user stories that we are working on by adding our

            developing or not. This is a good way of organizing and keeping our Asana Board nice and tidy.

          <p>We often do Pair Programming or Mob Programming when we get together as a team. We find this technique to be very
            useful as it allows us to learn from each other. In Pair or Mob Programming, the whole team communicates with
            each one another. We get to involve everyone in the team and get different inputs on how to solve a problem.
            This approach is a continous code review, therefore the team becomes more efficient as we get to code and reviews
            the code at the same time.

          <p>The team meets up once a week for a group discussion. The team finds it important to meet once a week because we
            are able to have face to face communication as a team. Through these face to face meetings, we are able to see
            the body language of everyone. This gives us live feedback from one another. We also found out that weekly meetings
            will help us build relationships, enhance trust, increase activity and increase effectiveness towards work that
            needs to be done.
          </p>
          <p>Moreover, we also have been doing By-Daily Standup Meetings. This allows us the team to have a daily plan and keep
            everyone in the team updated. This method lets the team know if someone is stuck with a current task or not.

        <p>Since the team cannot see each other a lot due to other commitments outside of the project, we have been using Facebook

          about the project, set up meetings and just communicate with one another. Moreover, the team uses Slack as another
          tool to communicate with each other. However, we usually use Slack for when we are communicating with our client.

                <p>For the front end of the stack Flaties uses HTML, CSS, Sass, ES6 and there is some jquery. At the start of the project it was mentioned we would start intergrating React in the frontend 
                  . In the second semster there was a disscusion of using Vue.js but the in the end went kept with what we were using. On the server side Flaties uses Node.js and express which then connects to mongoose to the mongoDB database. 
                  As a team we had to learn and understand these languages. At the beginning it took some time to understand the flow of how the data moved from the frontend to the backend via MVC model.

                <p>Gulp was used automate and enhance workflow, so each time we made a commit on GIT the Gulp files would run.</p>
                <p>Robomongo was used for the database on our local machine to we could see the data being CRUD.</p>

                  and general debugging. As a team we completed a full UAT report. We learnt about unit testing in our learning

                <p>When completing any feature tasks we would console.log or use js alert to track progress and see what the
                  object contained by printing it to the terminal. For HTML and CSS changes we use the google chrome developer
                  tools, this method was very effective visually as you could see the changes instantly.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/qa/googledevtools.png" alt="">
                <p>With the google dev tools we could test that our new feature was responsive for all devices</p>

                <p>Even though our clients did not require us to focus much on Unit Testing but our team still decided to ask
                  them whether we could be able to implement Unit Testing for Flaites and they were happy with it. </p>
                <p>So we did write couple of unit tests for the Helper functions and also for the routes as well </p>

                <p>The main issue we had which cuased a lot of risk for this project was getting hold of the client at the start
                  of the semester and then finding out they only wanted us to do user testing for the second semester. After
                  a meeting with our awesome supervisor we had a back up plan. Our original plan from our proposal had changed
                  signifficantly and our agile methodology had also skewed off its original path. View our Issue logs below</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Version control was another major issue, in the first stage of the semester when we would try push our code to GitLab we would use a non verify flag to force the code up to GitLab. 
                  This practice was risky as it may push poorly written code up to gitLab although we develop on a feature branch then merge to the develop after a peer code review. 
                  The main cause to the issue was due to GEM packages not beig installed and Ruby version was out of date once these where updated the team was able to push code correctly.
